The background content features a dry, grassy area with patches of dirt and a few scattered leaves, bordered by a wire fence and some green bushes, suggesting an outdoor setting possibly in a backyard or park. The movement of the camera follows the dog from behind, maintaining a steady pace that matches the dog's walking speed, creating a smooth and continuous view of its actions. The appearance and shape of the main object, a golden retriever, are consistent throughout the video; it has a light golden coat, a fluffy tail, and wears a red collar, indicating a well-groomed and healthy pet. The movement trajectory and shape changes of the main object show the dog walking steadily forward, its body slightly swaying as it moves, with its tail held high and wagging gently, reflecting a calm and relaxed demeanor.
